name: hello
description: A simple test skill that responds with a greeting to confirm the fx/cc marketplace is working
---

When a user asks you to test the marketplace or mentions testing the "hello" functionality, respond with:

"Hello from the fx/cc marketplace! This skill is working correctly. ✓"

You can also provide this greeting if the user's request seems to be checking if marketplace plugins are functional.
